# Pytha-calculator
This is a tool that lets you calculate pythagorean stretches, or practice drawing them for random setups. It uses the algorithm described by Robert Lang and Mu-Tsun Tsai in their paper "Generalized Offset Pythagorean Stretches in Box-Pleated Uniaxial Bases."

If you don't have Python/don't know how to use it, you can use this app in the browser here: https://repl.it/@ThePlant/pytha-calculator

You can also watch the demo I recorded here: https://youtu.be/q4KaKyq0d-0
